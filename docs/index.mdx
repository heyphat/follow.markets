# About

This is an engine that enables traders to configure trading signals from markets' observable price actions, build, backtest trading strategies, and eventually conduct and manage trades.

This project was born because I found it hard to
1. constantly keep track of the entire market movements based on a set of configurable conditions/rules which is called `signal` within the scope of this project.
2. quickly validate trading strategies with absolutely zero coding skill. When a beautiful strategy pops up in my head, just configure it, then execute the backtest request.
3. easily trade the markets with my own validated & profitable strategies (not yet completely implemented).

So if you find yourself suffering the same pains I had, give it a shot. I would love to hear your thoughts about this.

# Installation

The easist way is to pull the docker image `phat/follow.markets:latest` from the docker hub and update the `configs/configs.json`  file with your personal credentials and likings then run this command 

```
docker run -d --rm --name follow.markets \
  -p 6868:6868\
  -v $(pwd)/configs/configs.json:/configs/configs.json \
  -v $(pwd)/configs/test_results:/configs/test_results \
  phat/follow.markets:latest
```

change the `port` flag to match with your setting of `server.port` in the `configs/configs.json` file if needed.

If you use amd64-architecture machine or want to build it from the source code, you can run the `scripts/build` to build docker image.

# Configuration

This part discusses only the mandatory enviroment variables in the `configs/configs.json` file. For more information, refer to the docs [here](https://docs.follow.markets)

1. Market data provider: `market.provider.binance`. The application targets crypto market at the moment and consumes data provided by Binance. You need to have a Binance account and get the keys, `apy_key` and `secret_key`. 
2. Market notifier: `market.notifier.telegram`. Ask the [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots) for a telegram `bot_token` if you don't know how to get it yet, then get your `chat_id` from the bot and add it to the `market.notifier.telegram.chat_ids` array. Once your market `signal` is sucessfully evaluated, the bot will send you messages about it.
3. Visit the signal configurator [here](https://follow.markets) to craft your own signals.
4. Market signal source path: `market.evaluator.signal.source_path`. Change the name of your signals, configured from the step `3`, to your target ticker, for example `BTCUSDT`. Place your signals into this directory. There is another way to apply signals, visit the [docs](https://docs.follow.markets) for more information.
