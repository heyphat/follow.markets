# About

This project was born because I found it hard to
1. constantly keep track of the market movements based on a set of configurable conditions/rules which is called `signal` within the scope of this project.
2. quickly validate trading strategies with absolutely zero coding skill. When a strategy pops up in my head, just configure it and execute the backtest request.
3. effectively trade the markets with validated & profitable strategies.

# Installation

The easist way is to pull the docker image `phat/follow.markets:latest` and from doceker hub and update the `configs/configs.json`  file with your personal credentials and likings then run this command 

```
docker run -d --rm --name follow.markets \
  -p port:port \
  -v $(pwd)/configs/configs.json:/configs/configs.json \
  -v $(pwd)/configs/test_results:/configs/test_results \
  phat/follow.markets:latest
```

change the `port` flag to match with your setting of `server.port` in the `configs/configs.json` file.

If you use amd64-architecture machine or want to build it from the source code, you can run the `scripts/build` to build docker image.

# Configuration

This part discusses only the mandatory configurations in the `configs/configs.json` file. For more information, refer to the docs [here](https://docs.follow.markets)

1. Market data provider: `market.provider.binance`. The application targets crypto market at the moment and consumes data provided by Binance. You need to have a Binance account and get the keys, `apy_key` and `secret_key`. 

2. Market notification system: `market.notifier.telegram`. Ask the [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots) for a telegram `bot_token` if you don't know how to get it yet. And get you `chat_id` from the bot. Once your market `signal` is sucessfully evaluated, the bot will send you messages about it.
