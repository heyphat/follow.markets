1. `env`: the targeted environment when deploying the application, `development` or `production`. If it is `development`, some parts of the application won't be fully initialized to save API call credit. For example, `coinmarketcap` API calls.

3. `server`: this is the basic configuration of the application. The variables are self-explanatory. If you want to change the port where the application will be listening to, you can do it on `server.port`. 

4. `datadog`: if you want to monitor the application performance on datadog, you can set up a datadog agent and update the corresponding variables in this session. Otherwise, leaving it unchanged will be fine.

5. `market`: the main configuration you will need to understand and update for your system. The market consists of a few components which have their own configurations. 
    1. `provider`: market data providers.
        1. `binance`: currently the application tracks Binance spot and futures markets,  you need to have a Binance account and obtain the keys, `api_key` and `secret_key`.
        2. `coinmarketcap`: coinmarketcap APIs provide the fundamental data for coins and tokens, for example: supply and circulation. If the coinmarketcap `api_key` is missing, you won't be able to configure signals based on fundamentals.
    2. `notifier`: is responsible for communicating with users via telegram bot. Telegram is free and easy to use. 
        1. `bot_token`: a telegram bot token. Ask the [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots) for a telegram `bot_token` if you don't know how to get it yet. Then start a conversation with your bot after deploying the system. The bot'll notify you messages when your signals are successfully evaluated.
        2. `chat_ids`: a list of chatIDs. If you know your tele account chatID, you can configure it here. Otherwise, you can obtain it from the `bot`.
    3. `watcher`: is responsible for watching the markets. It holds the market data of all runners on the watchlist. 
        1. `base_market`: usually `USDT`, if you want `BUSD` or others, you can set it here. 
        2. `watchlist`: a list of regex patterns that are matched against all tradable tickers on Binance spot and futures markets. The sample watchlist in `configs/configs.json` matches all `USDT`-based pairs. If you want to watch only 1 ticker, `BTCUSDT` for example, you can just add `BTCUSDT` to the watchlist.
        3. `runner`: when a ticker matches the `watchlist` patterns, the watcher initializes it as a runner entity and starts to watch on it. A runner consists of multiple timeseries of candles and indicators. One timeseries is associated with one timeframe. 
            1. `frames`: a list of timeframes you want the watcher to watch on. The supported frames are: `1m`, `5m`, `10m`, `15m`, `30m`, `1h`, `2h`, `4h`, `1d`. The values must be in second. 
            2. `indicators`: a list of indicators. Refer to the `indicator` docs for a list of supported indicators. An indicator comes with a list of parameters, often be a list of window frames.
    4. `evaluator`: is responsible for evaluating your signals. Refer to the `evaluator` [docs]() for more information about how to build a signal. The values under this session should only be changed if you know what you are doing. 
        1. `singal.source_path`: the place to store all the signals. 
    5. `tester`: is responsible for testing your strategies. Refer to the `tester` [docs]() for more information about how to execute a backtest. The values under this session should only be changed if you know what you are doing.
        1. `save_path`: the place to save all the test results.
        2. `init_balance`: the initialized balance before testing.
        2. `profit_margin`: the profit margin.
        4. `loss_tolerance`: the loss tolerance.
